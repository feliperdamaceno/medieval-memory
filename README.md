## Game: Medieval Memory

![page-showcase](app-showcase/app-showcase.gif)

This is a memory game made in React to test my react skills. I've decided to create a game because it was fun and also keeps track of all the learning I've acquired from the last months. I hope you've enjoyed it!

## From me to you

Hi, my name is **Felipe!**

I'm a Front-End student who wants to share my learning with the community, helping other devs in the same situation.

At the moment I'm studying by myself in ðŸ’» online courses, ðŸ“„ reading the documentation, and ðŸ’ª hard practicing every day. So if I can, **you could too!**

I hope you've enjoyed this repository and have helped you in some way.

Thanks for checking out and have good learning ðŸ˜‰"
